Fiwix kernel coding standards
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's easier on everyone if all authors working on a shared code base are
consistent in the way they write their programs. Fiwix has the following
conventions in its code:

- Keep lines length to a maximum of 80 characters (some exceptions accepted).

- Use of snake_case (multi-word names are lower_case_with_underscores) for
  everything except for macro in #define directives.

- No space after the name of a function in a call.
  For example, printk("hello") not printk ("hello").

- Optional space after keywords "if", "for", "while", "switch".
  For example, if(x) or if (x).

- Space before braces (except in function declarations).
  For example, if(x) { not if(x){.

- Space between operands.
  For example, for(n = 0; n < 10; n++), not for(n=0;n<10;n++).

- Beginning-of-line indentation via tabs, not spaces.

- Preprocessor macros are always UPPERCASE.

- Pointer types have spaces: (uint16_t *), not (uint16_t*).

- Comments in code are always in C-Style (as in C89) /* ... */.

- Only the comments that span multiple lines start always with a capital letter
  and the last sentence ends with a period. Also the open and close tags must go
  in separate lines. Just like this:
  /*
   * Comment line 1
   * comment line 2
   * comment line 3.
   */

- Comments in a single line must not start with a capital letter and must not
  end with a period.

- Functions that take no arguments are declared as f(void), not f().

- The open parenthesis is always on the same line as the function name.

- There is never a space between the function name and the open parenthesis.

- There is never a space between the parentheses and the parameters.

- The open curly brace is always at the next line of the function declaration.

- Conditionals should always include curly braces, even if there is only a
  single statement within the conditional.
