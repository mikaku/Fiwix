===================
- Added support for UNIX98 pseudoterminals (pty).
- Added support for the devpts filesystem.
- Added the member s_blocksize_bits in the superblock struct to use bitwise
  shift instead of division in ext2_bmap() and ext2_truncate().
- Added the RSS column in the list of processes generated by the 'SysRq+t' key.
- Added the 'fd' structure as a new argument in ioctl() and select() methods.
- Added a free data pointer called 'private_data', in 'fd' structure, which is
  mostly used by the tty driver for now.
- Changed modulo operations by bitwise (where possible) to reduce dependency
  from libgcc.
- Removed some flags from LDFLAGS in the main Makefile that prevented compile
  the kernel with newer GCC versions. [#97]
- Removed the dir_write method from the ext2 and minix filesystems.
- Renamed the functions *_dir_readdir() and *_dir_readdir64() to *_readdir()
  and *_readdir64().

  space on device.

  (free_pages = 0)' when using a RAMdisk drive as the root filesystem. [#98]

- Added the new configuration option PAGE_HASH_PERCENTAGE (0.1% by default) to
  set the size of the page_hash_table relative to the number of physical memory
  pages, with a mininum of 1 page and a maximum of 16 pages. The kernel now

  layer enqueues a block request group with all the buffers needed in a read or
  write operation, and keeps sleeping until the whole transaction has been
  completed. This improves dramatically the disk accesses, reduces a lot the
  number of context switches, and it overall boosts the performance of the

  BLKSIZE_1K.

  ext2_balloc() and ext2_bfree().
- Fixed fbcon_blank_screen() to not show cursor. [#94]
- Fixed a lack of schedule randomization introduced in b935b3d.
- Fixed reclaim_buffers() to run with interrupts enabled.
- Fixed to initialize the new vma struct in merge_vma_regions().

  in irq_keyboard_bh().
- Fixed a long standing bug in vconsole_select() that prevented from switching
  between consoles in VT_PROCESS mode.
- Fixed permissions in the ioctl VT_WAITACTIVE.
- Fixed a long standing bug in wakeup() that put as running one in two processes
  sleeping, leading to frequent cases where some processes keep sleeping.
- Small fixes and cosmetic changes.

  non-existent user stack address in kernel mode when
  CONFIG_LAZY_USER_ADDR_CHECK is enabled. [#22]

  when CONFIG_LAZY_USER_ADDR_CHECK is disabled, since do_page_fault() will do
  the rest of the job. [#22]
- Fixed the logic in parse_arg() to support kernel parameters without arguments.
- Fixed a long standing bug where after removing an inode there was not a call
  to invalidate all its pages from the cache. [#24]

  middle.

- Fixed to avoid freeing an invalid page that generated PANICs in SVGAlib
  programs.

  wrong page number.

===================
- Added support for an initial RAMdisk (initrd) image.

- Limit the number of messages on spurious interrupts.
- RAMdisks initialization now shows the range of the memory addresses of each
  RAMdisk created.
- Added VMA_REGIONS as a general configurable option (default: 150 entries).
- Changed the default kernel filesystem to ext2.
- Renamed the sleep addresses in tty.c.
- Added the ability to pass arguments to init from the kernel's command line.
- Included memory values in /proc/PID/stat and /proc/PID/status.
- Included the file /proc/PID/statm to provide more information about memory
  usage.
- Changed the ATA's SET MULTIPLE MODE command to do all I/O with 4KB block size
  (8 sectors) by default.
- Fixed to prevent from using an unexistent floppy type, in the fdd_type
  structure, if CMOS returns a value bigger than 0x04.
- Fixed a misplaced bitwise operator AND that was not ensuring the limitation
  to 1GB as the amount of physical memory supported.
- Fixed some bugs in *_minix_ialloc() and minix_balloc() when they fail.
- Fixed a malfunction in the job control.
- Fixed in sys_getgroups() to return the number of group IDs when the argument
  size is zero.
- Fixed the DEC Set Top and Bottom Margins (DECSTBM) sequence, which affected
  the scroll up mechanism in consoles.
- Fixed to set properly the timestamp on every read and write in all ttys.
- Fixed the start time value in /proc/PID/stat of every single process.
- Fixed to use a long long variable type to be able support block devices bigger
  than 4GB.
